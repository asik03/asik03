I'm Asier Alcaide, a Software Engineer from Madrid (Spain) and living around Europe. Touching multiple stuff: IA/ML algorithms, highly scalable Big Data services, FinTech apps, disruptive payment systems and websites like this one.

While I was finishing my studies of Computer Sciences and Business Management in
<a href="https://www.uc3m.es/home">Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</a>
<a href="https://www.uc3m.es/home">(UC3M)</a>, I joined the Software Engineering team
at <a href="https://www.masmovil.es/">MasMovil</a>, a very fast-growing company that
has entered during the last years into the strong and competitive telecom industry in
Spain. There, I've worked on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on
a daily basis, as a DevOps Intern and then Java Developer.

When IÂ´m not doing that, I can be found in the mountains (Nature), learning about finance (Economy), or learning about our future incoming (Geopolitics). Ah! Almost forgot! I also use to challenge myself trying to cook new recipes that can surprise people :)
